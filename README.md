# JavaScript Event Carnival Setup

Create several HTML stations on a single webpage, each representing a different event. Each station provides a small activity related to a specific JavaScript event, helping students understand its behavior.

## Activity Stations

### Station 1: Click Me! (Click Event)

Goal: Learn the click event.
Instructions: Place a button that, when clicked, displays a message or changes color.

### Station 2: Mouse Tracker (Mouse Events)

Goal: Understand mousemove and mouseover events.
Instructions: Create an area that changes color as the mouse moves over it.

### Station 3: Key Press Challenge (Keyboard Events)

Goal: Experience keydown and keyup events.
Instructions: Create an input box where each keypress displays the pressed key below the box.

### Station 4: Form Submit Fun (Form Submission Event)

Goal: Practice submit event.
Instructions: Set up a simple form that displays a thank-you message when submitted.

### Station 5: Resize and Scroll (Window Events)

Goal: Observe resize and scroll events.
Instructions: Display a message that appears when the window is resized or scrolled.

## How It Works

Rotate: Rotate through each station, experimenting with each type of event and observing the results.

Debrief: After trying each station, lets discuss each event typeâ€™s characteristics and possible use cases.
